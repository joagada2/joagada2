# Hi There ðŸ‘‹
My name is Joseph Oche Agada. I am a data science professional with over 10 years of professional work experience. My specialization and current area of interest is in Machine Learning. I have the capacity to take on machine learning project from conceptualization to model monitoring. I have proven work and project experience and a track record of success across various areas of machine learning, from linear regression, classification, clustering, deep learning, computer vision, NLP, and Generative AI, to ranking and recommender systems.  My skill stack is as follows:

Python, SQL, PyTorch, Numpy, Searborn, Sckiti-learn, Tensorflow, Keras, Xgboost, FastApi, Flask, Prefect, BERT, NLTK, MLFlow, Dagshub, Git, DVC, Hydra, Heroku, MS Azure, GitHub Action, Streamlit, WhyLabs, SparkML, SparkMLib,  AWS, Fbprophet, TorchServe, XLNet, GPT, Simple Transformers, Docker, Kubernetes, SageMaker,  LazyPredict, Power BI, SHAP etc

# SELECTED PORTFOLIO PROJECT
Below are some selected portfolio projects. There are over 20 other fascinating project repositories

## [Project 1: Machine Learning System for Loan Default Prediction](https://github.com/joagada2/loan-default-prediction-model)
This is a complete end to end machine learning (binary classification) project. It covers all stages of ML lifecycle, from problem selection, model training, experiment tracking, model serving, real time/batch inferencing, model monitoring, workflow orchestration and CI/CD pipeline. Tech/skills used in this project are:
 - Python (Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikitlearn etc)
 - XGBoost - for model training
 - MLFlow - Experiment tracking
 - dagshub - Experiment tracking, data storage in the cloud and code hosting
 - Hydra - Managing configuration
 - FastAPI - Model Serving
 - Heroku - API exposed on Heroku
 - GitHub/GitHub Action - Code hosting and CI/CD pipeline
 - Streamlit - For creating web app that uses model for prediction
 - WhyLabs - Continous monitoring of model in production
 - Prefect - For workflow orchestration
 - Git - For project version control
 - DVC - For data version control

## [Project 3: Deep Learning Model for Detection of Malaria Infected Red Blood Cells](https://github.com/joagada2/deep_learning_model_for_detecting_malaria_infected_red_blood_cell)
In this computer vision project, I trained convolutional neural network which takes image of red blood cells and predict if the cell in malaria infected or not. The model has accuracy of 0.94. I also built a flask application for deployment of the model to production environment. Skills/tech used in this project include:
 - Python
 - Tensorflow - for model training
 - Keras - Tenforflow API
 - MLFlow - Experiment tracking
 - dagshub - Experiment tracking, data storage in the cloud and code hosting
 - FastAPI - Model Serving
 - Prefect - For workflow orchestration
 - Git - For project version control
 - WhyLabs - Continous monitoring of model in production
 - DVC - For data version control
 - GitHub - Code hosting

## My current interest is in building computer vision (objects detection) models for detection and identification on non-conventional military targets on space-borne and airborne sensor images.
